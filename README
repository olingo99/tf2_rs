# tf2_rust: ROS2 TF2 Bridge for Rust

`tf2_rust` is a Rust library designed to bridge ROS2's TF2 functionalities with Rust applications. It leverages the `cxx` crate to provide a Rust API for interacting with ROS2 TF2 features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- ROS2 (Humble or later)
- Rust (stable)
- Cargo
- [cxx crate](https://crates.io/crates/cxx)
- ROS2 Rust client library [`ros2_rust`](https://github.com/ros2-rust/ros2_rust)

### Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <your_repo_url>
cd tf2_rust
```

Build the library:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Examples

### ROS2 Integrated Example

Here's a simple ROS2 node demonstrating basic TF2 functionality:

```bash
cargo run --example tf2_ros2_node
```

The node subscribes to a ROS2 topic and performs TF2 lookups based on incoming messages.

### Standalone Example

For a ROS2-free minimal example:

```bash
cargo run --example tf2_standalone
```

This demonstrates adding and querying TF2 transforms without needing a ROS2 node running.

## Usage

Import the library in your Rust project:

```rust
use tf2_rust::bridge;

fn main() {
    let tf2 = bridge::get_tf2_instance();

    tf2.add_transform(0, 0, "source_frame", "target_frame", 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);

    match tf2.lookup_last_transform("source_frame", "target_frame") {
        Ok(transform) => println!("Transform: {:?}", transform),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}
```
